# Hello World!

## Who am I?
My name is Mohamed Nour Sabir (though I prefer being called Nour). I am currently a 1st year Computer Science and Technology student at Dawson, with a passion of learning all about Web Development and Cybersecurity. I have also participated in multiple hackathons and game jams in order to hone my skills in programming!
